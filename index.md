Hi! My name is Pranay, I am currently a Doctoral Candidate supervised by Prof. Dr. Els Lefever at the [Language and Translation Technology Team (LT3), UGent](https://lt3.ugent.be). My primary areas of interest include *Cross-Lingual Supervision*, *Low-Resource NLP*, *Transfer Learning* and *Interpretability*. <br>
I have previously worked in the R&D Team of retail AI startup [Paralleldots](https://www.paralleldots.com/), before which I was a student at [BITS Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/). <br>
In my free time I enjoy listening to progressive music, reading fantasy and I occasionally dabble with writing.
