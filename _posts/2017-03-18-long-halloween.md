description: Chronicles of a Patient in a Mental Asylum
---

I see extraordinary things everyday. I see ghosts, I sometimes manipulate objects with the will of my mind. People would give a lot to see and do the things I do, but not what I gave. I gave my mind away. I am crazy. My parents died when I was 18 in an accident and I have spent 12 years of my life in the Mahkra mental asylum after I attempted suicide twice.

You must think I am foolish to attempt suicide. To throw my life away. But you are not someone who can judge. You do not what it feels like. It's not about my parents, its about normality. You have a normal life and you seek thrills. Thrills that are like an antidote to the poison and boredom of normalcy.  But when something like this happens. You pray for normal. You would give everything just to get normal but never again. Nothing is the same again. Even daily activities like brushing your teeth and reading the paper feel different. You change and because of that the world around you seems strange too. Pardon the senseless ranting, it will not mean anything to you but read it again when something happens and you might just understand.

I see weird things everyday. Weird even for an asylum. I mean watching a naked man enacting a light saber battle with sound effects involving spitting and coughing is average on mental asylum scale. But I see even weirder things. My wheel chair sometimes moves even when someones not pushing it. I sometimes have things to eat in my hand even when I did not pick them up. I talked to my father for an hour a week back. I know I am crazy, but I can't help it. These things just happen I have to go through them. I laugh at my selves and my condition. But there is nothing I can do about it. Recently, I took another step to being completely insane. One of my first childhood memories was of going to Disney World with my parents. I was thinking about it for an hour or so and there it was. I was in Disney World. I knew it was all fake but I roamed for a while reliving old memories and then I suddenly was back in my confined room. Similar events happened a couple of times, once I visualized our old home, then once the lake we used to go to on Sundays. I started enjoying the visions. They were so relaxing. It was nice to be away from the place which reminded of my mental state again and again.

You might think I am naive to find joy in something that I know is fake but again, you have never lived in an asylum for 12 years so you would not know. I started controlling these visions and seeing things I wanted. This went on for a while. It was a month later I think around the time when my neighbor Mr. Gabriel was telling us the story of how he killed his wife's murderer for the tenth time. I had an idea. Maybe seeing the truck driver who killed my parents would give me some peace of mind.  I knew it was crazy, but for a man in my condition it was definitely worth a shot. I decided to talk with him for a while. I planned for it for days. I picked Halloween to be the day. I decided what I would say to him. I remembered everything about that night for days. 

The day came. I told my caretaker I was going to sleep early and that nobody was to disturb me. I sealed my room from noise and light. Switched off all lights and sat on the bed. I started to focus on the man. I remembered everything about him. He was well built. About 6 feet tall and scary, very scary. He had multiple tattoos on his arms. His eyebrows were thick and devilish, so were his eyes. Everything about him chilled me. Especially the way he said in the court that it was my parents fault as they were driving on the wrong side. Cold, without an expression, no remorse, no guilt and probably no conscience. 

Nothing happened. I was still in my cell. I knew it would happen. I had done it before. I kept on focusing. My brows became sweaty, my teeth were gritting as I closed my eyes as much as is humanly possible. It was all black. Blacker than ever. Like the kind of black you think would only be in hell. Then I felt it. The temperature changed. I could feel my breath. I was sitting on a seat and my naked feet were resting on metal. I opened my eyes and found myself sitting in a car, outside a small house. His house.

I walked out into the chilly air. The gravel of the road touched my feet as I felt it prick against my skin. I opened the lawn gate and walked into the lawn. They were beautiful. Green luscious grass, no sign of weeds. Without a second thought I walked to the front door and knocked thrice. I heard kids shouting as a person rushed to the door. The door opened with a creak and I found myself facing a middle aged blond woman who looked irritated.

“Yes mister, How can I help you?” she said.

“I am here to see Mr. Jack Napier on an urgent matter, Please.” I said politely.

“Wait outside, I will find him.” she said as she rushed back inside. I heard her screaming and a few minutes later. There he was. But he looked different. He looked normal. He no more had that smug expression. That criminal appearance. He looked like a family man. Dressed in a shirt and trousers, with a regular man's hear cut. He looked ordinary.

“Hi, Mr. Napier I need to talk to you about a matter of the court. If you are free, it is a little urgent.” I said calmly.

“Look, mister if this is about my sister I do not want to hear it.” he said.

“No, no. It is actually about that accident in that Mahtog place. That truck accident. That case has been reopened actually.” I said

“Oh crap. I do not want to go through that again. I went through a lot of trouble, mister. I do not want to go through it again. And I sure as hell do not want my family to find out.” he said panicking a little.

“It's alright nothing too intense. I would just like to hear your part of the story.” I said.

“Alright, please have a seat in the garden. Why are you not wearing shoes by the way?” he asked politely.

“Oh, I spilled coffee all over them. Had to dump them in the back of the trunk. So tell me what happened that night.” I said composed as ever.

“Well, nothing much to tell really. I was carrying a load of containers for my employers which they needed urgently. I was driving at 50 when suddenly a car appears in front of me. Could not slam the brakes in time and Wham!” he said coolly.

“So you did nothing wrong right.” I asked gritting my teeth.

“No, absolutely nothing. I was on my side. I was within the speed limit and everything.” he said.

“What about the fact that you were high?” I asked with a smug smile.He immediately got of his feet. His nerves were spouting.

“How the hell did you know that? That is not public knowledge.” he said obviously pissed.

“Well, it is my job to know. You did cost me a lot that night.” I said standing up.

“Excuse me.” he said.

“I am their son, Jack. The son of Martha and Thomas. The people you killed because you were high and got away because your employer was a big shot. Remember everything clearly know?” I asked almost shouting now. He started backing off. He bent down to pick a shovel from his garden floor.

“Stay away, mister.” he said shivering.

“I am just here to talk.” I said.

“Well, I do not care. You can get out right now or I am calling the police for trespassing. I have my children here for god's case. Get lost right now.” he said as calmly as he could.

“You should burn for what you did. You stole my life. You do not deserve this. You should not have children. You are not fit to bring up a family.” I screamed.

He could not bear it anymore. He came charging down at me with his shovel. I fell on the grass. He struck me once in my stomach. Blood spurted out of my mouth. It was streaming hot. I was impressed at the details my mind captured. At this point, I realized it was still a dream. My dream. A gun suddenly materialized in my right hand and I shot him instantly in the foot. He fell down screaming in pain. I got up looked him in the eye. Thought about my parents and then shot him three times in the chest. His wife came screaming out. She saw what happened and broke down crying.

I woke up to the sound of banging on the door. Relieved that I had been taken away from that place I got up to open the door. My heart was still pumping faster than a horse's heart. My fingers were trembling. I felt good. I opened the door to find my caretaker Harley standing outside.

“Bruce, we heard some screaming and, Oh my god what is that?” she said looking at my hands.

I looked down to find my hands holding a gun, covered in blood.
